        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Stephen William Hawking was a world-renowned theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author.
            He made groundbreaking contributions to the fields of cosmology, general relativity, and quantum gravity,
            particularly in the context of black holes. Despite being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease (ALS) 
            at the age of 21, which left him almost completely paralyzed, Hawking continued to work and inspire millions 
            through his research and writings. His best-selling book, <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, brought complex 
            scientific concepts to the public in an accessible way. His perseverance, intellect, and curiosity about the 
            universe made him one of the most admired scientists in history.
